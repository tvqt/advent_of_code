# Day 19: Robot Blueprint
# https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/19
# I tried out a couple of other people's solutions after completing mine, and they were significantly faster than mine. Not entirely sure why. One used recursion and multithreading, the other cut the search space at an arbitrary point, which I'm guessing is the main reason for the speedup. Either that, or I'm just bad at Julia lol
# a few potential speedups: 1. multithreading, 2. switching the vectors to be arrays/tuples, 3. adding types to everything, 4. creating a dictionary of the minutes it takes to get from one state to another, so that analagous states don't have to be recalculated, 5. using a different data structure for the queue, 6. using a different heuristic function, 7. using a different algorithm entirely
